# Automatic Emulator Updater

AEUStartup installation instructions:

*Before AEUStartup will work, your emulators and directories need to be setup in the AEU.exe.

- Right click on AEUStartup and click create shortcut.
- Copy or cut it and paste it into the Windows StartUp directory:
   C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
- AEUStartup should then automatically go through its processes on boot based on what you entered in AEU.

You can check what happened during each startup by reading the "updateLog.txt" file
that is created in the same directory where the AEU.exe and AEUStartup.exe files
are located.

*Make sure to keep the AEU.exe and AEUStartup.exe files in the same directory together
